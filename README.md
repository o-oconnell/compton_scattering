# compton_scattering
A simple modeling program demonstrating compton scattering and photon behavior as a particle of no mass that has momentum.

Right now just prints out results for a known phi (the angle betweeen the incoming photon's direction and the scattered photon's direction) and lambda (wavelength). 

Compile and run with:

$ make

$ ./compton_program
