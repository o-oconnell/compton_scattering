====================
Building the project
====================

This project uses one simple Makefile. It can be modified easily if you need to modify the project (and it is licensed accordingly under the GPL- you are encouraged to do so).

You can make the executable using:

.. code-block:: bash

   make


You can make the Doxygen documentation using:

.. code-block:: bash

   make doxygen


You can also remake the Sphinx documentation if necessary:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd docs
   make html
