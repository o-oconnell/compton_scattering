// this file will contain the GTK code that allows us to
// have multiple threads displaying information based on the input we get from
// the user - likely one thread will accept input from the slider and
// get a struct containing the calculated result, while another thread
// (later on) will display a graph of the lamda-prime wavelength
// (or perhaps something more interesting)
