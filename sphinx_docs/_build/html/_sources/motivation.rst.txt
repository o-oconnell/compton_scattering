Motivation, purpose, plan
=========================
This project serves as a general introduction to Compton scattering and as a calculator for the various energies, momentums, and wavelengths involved with Compton scattering. As a result, it can be useful both for students who want to learn more about Compton scattering and for students who need to check calculations for a modern physics class. It is also heavily commented, so it could potentially be helpful for learning about building multi-file projects in C++ or for learning how to use GTK+3.0 to build graphical projects.
